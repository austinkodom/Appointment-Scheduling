# Appointment-Scheduling

Problem: 
    Suppose that a doctor needs an application to help schedule his appointments.
    Appointments are scheduled Mon-Fri.
    No appointments shall conflict in a single day.
    The day with the most appointments gets priority for new appointments,
    preserving his lighter workload days.
    If an appointment conflicts for each day, then that appointment cannot be filled.
